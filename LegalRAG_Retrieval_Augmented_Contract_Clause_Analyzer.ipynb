            "  It is difficult to determine if you will get a job with this resume as it depends on various factors such as the job market, your skills and experience, and the specific requirements of the job you are applying for. However, having a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and relevant courses and certifications in areas such as Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management System, and Artificial Intelligence can make you a strong candidate for a software developer role. Additionally, your experience as a Graduate Academic Trainee at HCLTech and your contributions to validation and performance monitoring of platform-level systems can also be valuable for a software developer role. It is important to continue to develop your skills and gain experience in the field to increase your chances of getting a job as a software developer.\n",
